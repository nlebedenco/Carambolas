  "description": "Carambolas is a custom multi-channel reliable UDP protocol implementation for low latency/low bandwidth-delay network applications with soft real-time constraints featured in a collection of .NET Standard 2.0 support assemblies.\n\nThis package contains core classes ranging from cryptography to basic log and string resource manager implementations.\n\nSystem.Memory.dll (>= 4.5.3) is required but was intentionally not included to prevent conflicts with other third-party packages. If you don't have a System.Memory.dll in your project you may install the dotnet.system.memory package.",
